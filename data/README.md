# Data Puller
This data puller script works off of PR Newswire for obtaining the press release content. Some companies do not use PR Newswire and use other services for delivery of press releases (e.g. Apple delivers using their own website/platform).

Data should be obtained in a CSV file with a fixed structure similar to the provided examples for Neurotrope in this folder.
