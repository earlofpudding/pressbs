"," ) (""Neurotrope"" or the ""Company"") today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Neurotrope Bioscience, Inc. (""NBI""), has entered into a services agreement with Worldwide Clinical Trials (""WCT"") to support site recruitment and activation for the Company's ongoing Phase 2 study of bryostatin-1 in the treatment of moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (""AD"").  The Phase 2 clinical study is being conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (""NIH"") under a  , Neurotrope's President and Chief Scientific Officer. ""This is our first extended trial that will include twice the number of treatment doses than used previously.  Understanding Bryostatin-1's potential to treat moderately severe patients – a population informed by benefit seen in our prior studies – is critical to potentially delivering new treatment options to this neglected area of AD research, where no effective treatments currently exist.""  This Phase 2 clinical study is expected to enroll approximately 100 patients, will evaluate Bryostatin-1 in the absence of Namenda for a 6-month period, which will include two 11-week dosing cycles.  This study will focus on AD patients with pre-specified moderately severe (Moderate Stratum; MMSE-2 baseline score 14-10) and moderate (MMSE-2 baseline score 18–15) disease, including a patient population that demonstrated the most evidence of benefit in a prior study, and will focus on assessing sustained cognitive benefit as measured by the Severe Impairment Battery (""SIB"") score, a widely accepted measure of cognitive function in advanced dementia patients. Analysis of the data will be conducted in consultation with Dr.  This new Phase 2 study is supported by Phase 2 clinical data from a completed pilot trial (NTRP101-202), which evaluated Bryostatin-1 in the absence of Namenda in a short-term, 11-week treatment protocol.  In this prior study, Bryostatin-1 (20 mcg) was well tolerated and showed early signals of cognitive benefit, including a 5.0 improvement in SIB score compared to baseline in the Moderate Stratum cohort in the non-Namenda group.  This SIB score improvement was sustained throughout the treatment period and persisted for 4 weeks following completion of treatment.  A second pilot trial (NTRP101-203) using the same treatment protocol (Bryostatin-1 in the absence of Namenda for 11 weeks) showed a similar SIB improvement compared to baseline for the Moderate Stratum cohort. Neurotrope is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company working to develop novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Neurotrope has conducted clinical and preclinical studies of its lead therapeutic candidate, Bryostatin-1, in AD, and preclinical studies for rare diseases and brain injury, including Fragile X syndrome, multiple sclerosis, stroke, Niemann-Pick Type C disease, Rett syndrome, and traumatic brain injury. The Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug Designation to Neurotrope for Bryostatin-1 as a treatment for Fragile X syndrome. Bryostatin-1 has already undergone testing in more than 1,500 people in cancer studies, thus creating a large safety data base that will further inform clinical trial designs.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays essential roles in cell proliferation, neurogenesis, cognition, and synaptic integrity. The BDNF signaling pathways in the brain are regulated by specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. The PKC-BDNF signaling pathways play essential roles in maintaining synaptic functions and structures and a variety of memory tasks. PKC ε activation with Bryostatin-1 promotes BDNF expression and secretion, and synaptogenesis, and provides protective effects against a variety of neurotoxic factors such as amyloidosis, tauopathy, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and oxidants.

"," ) a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), is announcing a collaboration with The Nemours / Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children (""Nemours"") to initiate a clinical trial in children with Fragile X Syndrome (""Fragile X"").  The planned protocol for the pilot open-label trial will dose Fragile X patients from 8 to less than 18 years of age, using a dosing regimen similar to that being tested in AD patients. In addition to the primary objective of safety and tolerability, measurements will be made of working memory, language and other functional aspects such as anxiety, repetitive behavior, executive functioning, and social behavior.   ""We are delighted to be collaborating with clinical scientists at Nemours on this important study for Fragile X.  As one of the premier children's hospitals in  Fragile X is characterized by synaptic immaturity, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes that currently have no effective therapeutics. The disorder is caused by transcriptional shutdown in neurons of the FMR1 gene product, the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).  Fragile X, a childhood neurological disorder that afflicts approximately 135,000 individuals in the U.S., is characterized by widespread loss of synaptic connections and occurs early in the neurological development process. ""Alzheimer's disease and Fragile X have a common devastating consequence in the brain: the loss of functional and anatomically normal synaptic networks – the loss of the brain's ""wiring.""  Bryostatin's target, PKC epsilon, was shown in extensive pre-clinical testing to restore these lost synaptic structures.  Neurotrope is collaborating with Nemours on an early clinical trial with dose frequency that is similar to the completed Phase 2 trial with AD patients that suggested promising improvement in cognitive functions,"" stated Dr.  With a transgenic, pre-clinical model of Fragile X, Bryostatin-1 caused benefits similar to those produced in AD transgenic mice - restoration of synaptic structures. Bryostatin-1 is a relatively selective PKC epsilon activator which appears to induce synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation by activating synaptic growth factors present in the brain. Such cognitive benefits and synaptic restoration have not been demonstrated by any drugs tested in pre-clinical Fragile X models.  Bryostatin-1 has been granted Orphan Drug status for the treatment of Fragile X by the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA""). ""The mechanism of Bryostatin-1 is novel compared to all prior drug treatments studied in Fragile X. It will be important to explore this mechanism in an early phase Fragile X human study. Early signs of positive target engagement and potential change on quantitative outcome measures will work to justify  ryostatin-1 rescues young Fragile X mice from the disorder phenotypes, including normalization of most Fragile X abnormalities in: 1) hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression; 2) postsynaptic density-95 levels; 3) transformation of immature dendritic spines to mature synapses; 4) densities of the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, and; 5) spatial learning and memory. Our pre-clinical results demonstrate that synaptic and cognitive function of young Fragile X mice can potentially be normalized through pharmacological treatment without down-regulation of mGluR5 and that Bryostatin-1-like agents may represent a novel class of drugs to treat the effects of Fragile X at a young age and in adults.

The data and comprehensive statistical analysis are being presented in the  In preclinical studies Bryostatin-1 lowers beta amyloid levels by the activation of natural enzymatic pathways in the brain such as IDE, ECE and neprilysin. Bryostatin has also shown synaptogenesis and prevention of neuronal death in extensive pre-clinical studies by activating synaptic growth factors such as BDNF, IGF and NGF. Further data analysis of the recent Phase 2 trial results showed that advanced AD patients show improvement (> 6.0 points vs. placebo and baseline) in the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) even 30 days after all drug dosing has been completed in patients not on memantine. In Neurotrope's previous Phase 2 trial of Bryostatin-1 for moderate-to-severe AD patients, Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) scores were consistently greater than baseline, indicating improvement for patients treated with a specific dose regimen, (20 µg protocol). The magnitude of this SIB increase above baseline was much greater when a pre-specified exploratory analysis separated out patients who were not on standard of care memantine therapy. Patients not on memantine treatment exhibited an improvement of 6.1 points over baseline and placebo, in their SIB scores. This was confirmed using three different comprehensive statistical analyses detailed in the poster being presented. Patients dosed in the 20 µg group in combination with memantine background therapy, and the patients on placebo with donepezil background therapy, did not show an increase above the baseline score on the SIB scale.  ""Because of the impressive improvement in the patients treated with the 20 µg dose of bryostatin who were not on memantine, Neurotrope has made the conservative decision to launch a confirmatory Phase 2 trial testing 100 moderate-to-severe AD patients with the 20 µg dose of Bryostatin-1 in a 1:1 ratio versus placebo. We are delighted to have initiated enrollment of the study earlier this month,"" said Dr.  Preclinical findings by other labs confirm that memantine would likely block bryostatin's observed improvement in cognition, due to their use of a shared cell signaling pathway.  Both memantine and bryostatin engage the same receptor, the NMDA receptor. Memantine directly blocks the NMDA receptor. In the absence of memantine, bryostatin activates PKC, causing engagement of the NMDA receptor. These clinical study results validate Neurotrope's proposed mechanism of action for bryostatin and its expected effects at a neuronal level, further bolstering the Company's clinical program and informing the development of a pivotal trial protocol for Bryostatin-1 in moderate-to-severe AD patients.  Neurotrope is at the forefront of developing a new approach to combating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The Company's world-class science offers the potential to realize a paradigm shift to overcome one of today's most challenging clinical problems — finding a way to slow, or even prevent the progression of AD.

"," ) today announced that a post-hoc analysis of data from its Phase 2 trial in patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) found evidence of improvement in cognition in patients receiving the 20μg bryostatin regimen who did not receive memantine, an approved AD treatment, as background therapy. The findings suggest this investigational drug could potentially help treat the progression of AD, rather than only its symptoms. The findings will be presented by  Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is marketed under the brand names Namenda®, Namenda® XR, and Namzaric® (a combination of memantine and donepezil) for the treatment of dementia in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. It has been shown to delay cognitive decline and help reduce disease symptoms. The interaction between NMDA function and protein kinase C (PKC) has been well studied, and the scientific rationale elucidating the interactions are explored in many peer reviewed publications.   ""The discovery that an NMDA inhibitor like memantine may diminish the effect of bryostatin, a PKC epsilon activator is very interesting as it is consistent with the proposed mode of action of bryostatin, and provides an internal control within the trial. This represents one of the most promising new developments in AD research and is welcome news following so many heartbreaking disappointments in the field,"" said  , an internationally recognized leader in AD research who recently joined Neurotrope's Board as a Director. ""These findings suggest that, for the first time, we may be able to reverse cognitive decline and actually improve cognition in people with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. It will be important to further investigate these results with confirmatory studies."" In this exploratory Phase 2 study in 150 patients with advanced AD, two doses of bryostatin (20μg and 40μg) were compared with controls to assess safety and preliminary efficacy after 12 weeks of treatment. The pre-specified primary endpoint, the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) used to evaluate cognition in severe dementia, compared each dose of bryostatin with controls at week 13 in two sets of patients: 1) the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (consisting of all patients who received the study drug and had at least one efficacy/safety evaluation), and 2) the Completers population (consisting of those patients within the mITT population who completed the 13-week assessment). As previously reported, the 20μg dose was found to be safe and well tolerated, and showed evidence of sustained improvement in cognition compared to controls, while the 40μg dose did not show an improvement in cognition. Neurotrope is planning a confirmatory study in advanced AD patients not taking memantine as background therapy to evaluate whether the improvements in SIB scores in those patients can be replicated. The company is in discussions with a leading academic institution to design and conduct the trial, which is expected to begin in the first half of 2018.

"," ) today presented clinical results from its recently completed Phase 2 trial demonstrating that moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients treated with 20 µg bryostatin-1 showed preliminary evidence of sustained improvement in cognition compared to placebo. The data and comprehensive statistical analysis were presented in the  The 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of bryostatin-1 in 147 moderate-to-severe AD patients across three treatment arms (20 µg, 40 µg, placebo). This is the first placebo-controlled, AD trial of a protein kinase C epsilon (PKCɛ) activator, which in preclinical studies induced the growth of new synapses and prevented neuronal death. This represents a new therapeutic strategy for AD that directly addresses the emerging consensus that synaptic loss has a major impact on cognitive deficits of AD. The improvements in the primary cognitive endpoint, the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), were observed in the study's 20 µg treatment arm as early as week five, and were maintained throughout the 13-week study (Table1). The scores for the secondary functional endpoint, the ADCS-ADL-SIV (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Severe Impairment Version) for the 20 µg treatment arm showed improvement at week 13. Unlike the 20 µg dose, there was no therapeutic signal observed with the 40 µg dose. This contrast between the signal observed with the 20 µg dose versus the 40 µg dose was reinforced by the results of a Cohen's D analysis, part of an in-depth statistical evaluation of the study data that found a consistent signal of benefit in SIB and ADCS-ADL-SIV for the 20 µg dose at the end of the trial.   , PhD of Pentara Corporation, a leading expert in statistical analysis of AD clinical trial results. ""Standardized effect sizes were small for the sensitivity analyses for the 20 µg group. Using a standardized effect size such as Cohen's D allows comparison of effects between different scales in a way that is independent of the sample size."" Patients dosed with 20 µg had a dropout rate similar to placebo, while patients dosed at 40 µg experienced poorer safety and tolerability, and had a higher dropout rate.  Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs, including serious adverse events, were more common in the 40 µg group, as compared to the 20 µg and placebo groups. These data reinforce the safety and tolerability of the 20 µg dose. Bryostatin-1 is a protein kinase C epsilon (PKCɛ) activator that works through synaptic growth factors, as well as anti-amyloid and anti-tangle signaling pathways in the brain. It has been shown in preclinical efficacy studies to induce the growth of mature synapses in the brain and prevent neuronal death. Thus, Bryostatin-1 introduces a fundamentally different biological mechanism of action with the potential for longer lasting effects than the other currently available therapies. Bryostatin-1 is the first PKCε modulator to be tested in a phase 2 clinical study for patients suffering from moderate to severe AD — a difficult to treat population.    models of AD demonstrating that modulation of PKCε by Bryostatin-1 enhances synaptogenesis and prevents neuronal death. As synaptic loss is tightly correlated with cognitive impairment in AD, this attribute of the molecule made bryostatin an intriguing candidate for additional investigation in dementia.

"," ) today announced positive top-line results from its Phase 2 study (-202 Study) of Bryostatin-1 in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), a population not commonly targeted in AD clinical trials. Bryostatin-1, a Protein Kinase C epsilon activator that works through synaptic growth factors, as well as anti-amyloid and anti-tangle signaling pathways in the brain, has been shown, in non-clinical efficacy studies, to induce the growth of mature synapses in the brain and prevent neuronal death. Thus, Bryostatin-1 has a fundamentally different biological mechanism of action with the potential for longer lasting effects than the other currently marketed drugs for AD (e.g., donepezil (Aricept®) and memantine (Namenda®)).   This Phase 2 study was the first repeat dose study of Bryostatin-1 in patients with late stage AD (defined as a Mini Mental State Exam 2 (MMSE-2) of 4-15), in which two dose levels of Bryostatin-1 were compared with placebo to assess safety and preliminary efficacy (p < 0.1, one-tailed) after 12 weeks of treatment. The pre-specified primary endpoint, the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) (used to evaluate cognition in severe dementia), compared each dose of Bryostatin-1 with placebo at Week 13 in two sets of patients: 1) the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (consisting of all patients who received study drug and had at least one efficacy/safety evaluation), and 2) the Completer population (consisting of those patients within the mITT population who completed the 13-week assessment).  Top-line results indicate that the 20 µg dose, administered every two weeks, met the pre-specified primary endpoint in the Completer population, but not in the mITT population.  Among the patients who completed the protocol (n = 113), the patients on the 20 µg dose at 13 weeks showed a mean increase on the SIB of 1.5 vs. a decrease in the placebo group of -1.1 (improvement of 2.6) (p < 0.07) (n = 80), whereas, in the mITT population, the 20 mcg group had a mean increase on the SIB of 1.2 vs. a decrease in the placebo group of -0.8 (improvement of 2.0) (p < 0.134) (n = 90). A total of 147 patients were enrolled into the study; 135 patients in the mITT population and 113 in the Completer population. The Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Severe Impairment version (ADCS-ADL-SIV) was a secondary endpoint. The p values for the comparisons between 20 µg and placebo for the ADCS-ADL endpoint were 0.082 and 0.104, respectively, among the patients who completed the protocol in the mITT population. Analysis of secondary and numerous additional exploratory endpoints are ongoing. Together these results indicate, in this relatively small trial, that Bryostatin-1, at the 20 µg dose, improved outcomes in  important dimensions that are impaired in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease i.e., cognition and the ability to care for oneself. Since most of the patients in this study were already taking donepezil and/or memantine, the efficacy of Bryostatin-1 was in addition to standard of care. The safety profile of Bryostatin-1 20 µg was similar to that of the placebo group except for a somewhat higher incidence of diarrhea. Fewer adverse events were reported in patients in the 20 µg group, compared to the 40 µg group. The mean age of patients in the study was 72 years and similar across all three treatment groups.  ""The results of this relatively small randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of Bryostatin-1 shows that Bryostatin-1 has the potential to positively impact the lives of these severely debilitated patients with moderate to severe AD, a population that is in dire need of new therapies, especially drugs with a new mechanism of action,"" said Dr.  , Neurotrope's Chief Executive Officer. ""We are excited to take the next steps in advancing the development of Bryostatin-1 to treat this serious disease that every year becomes a larger and larger public health burden in the U.S. and around the world. Additional development, with a path to Phase 3, is clearly warranted."" ""These results, which show improvement in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, the population that is generally recognized as the most difficult to treat, provide exciting evidence of a new therapeutic approach potentially could rejuvenate synaptic networks in the brain. Improvements across the range of important manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disease, as shown in this Phase 2 study, could potentially represent a shift in the paradigm to treat Alzheimer's disease,"" said Dr.  Further analysis of the data from the Phase 2 -202 Study is ongoing, and Neurotrope plans to present more data and analyses from this study at future medical conferences.  Once all of the data and analyses have been reviewed, the Company plans to meet with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the clinical and regulatory path forward for Bryostatin-1.   Neurotrope is at the forefront of developing a novel therapy to treat and potentially reverse moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases.

"," Dr. Alkon described accumulating evidence that many memory disorders, particularly those due to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Fragile X mental retardation, share common features of memory-related pathology: the loss and degeneration of synapses and synaptic networks in the brain.  Memory therapeutics, such as Bryostatin currently being clinically tested by Neurotrope, could restore synapses that were lost due to a number of types of neurodegeneration as occurs in Fragile X mental retardation, Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.   Synaptic loss, appears, therefore, to constitute a critical point of pathologic convergence in memory disorders, and their restoration would be essential to restore lost functions of brain networks. Bryostatin, which may induce synaptogenesis – i.e. the creation of new synapses – and may prevent neuronal death, has demonstrated promising potential in genetic models of both Fragile X mental retardation and Alzheimer's disease to slow, halt, and even reverse progressive loss of cognitive functions of these disorders at the level of the molecular structures of brain synapses.   Bryostatin has also undergone successful testing in a Phase II A trial and Compassionate Use trials, and is now being tested in an ongoing Phase II B trial.   This potential efficacy of Bryostatin and related drugs may work through synaptogenic molecular cascades that increase the synthesis and activity of growth factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF).  As such, Neurotrope's drug platform has shown the potential to have universal therapeutic value for many forms of memory disorders.  ""The restoration and rejuvenation of synaptic networks in brain disorders such as Fragile X and Alzheimer's disease could open a new era in the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders,"" said Dr. Alkon.   Neurotrope BioScience, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Neurotrope, Inc., is at the forefront of biotechnology companies having a focus on developing a novel therapy for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease.

"," ) today announced that its lead Alzheimer's drug Bryostatin improved disease symptoms and restored normal synaptic networks in a young transgenic animal model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a common genetic cause of mental retardation and autism.  The study led by scientists at the Blanchette Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (BRNI) demonstrated that chronic treatment with bryostatin-1 rescues young fragile X mice (corresponding to 15 – 16 year old children) from the disorder phenotypes, including reversal of most FXS abnormalities of 1) hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, 2 the synaptic anchoring protein, PSD-95, levels, 3) transformation of immature dendritic synapses to fully mature, developed synapses, 4) sub-cellular densities of the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, and 5) spatial learning and memory.  These results were long lasting and confirmed by electron microscopy.  While other attempts at Fragile X therapeutics have focused on reduced mGluR5 receptor levels, the Bryostatin efficacy for treating Fragile X did not require changes of mGluR5 and were even more dramatic than those of a late-onset treatment in adult Fragile X mice.  As a result of the mutation of the FMR1 gene, the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is not produced.  It is known that this protein is abundant in the neurons of the hippocampus and cerebellum of non-affected individuals, but it is not yet fully understood why the absence of FMRP results in the phenotype of Fragile X.  We have found that chronic activation of PKCε in the hippocampus by Bryostatin can rescue synapses and spatial cognition, as well as other FXS phenotypes.  This rescue in Fragile X mice is remarkably similar to the rescue of synapses, spatial cognition, and other Alzheimer's disease (AD) phenotypes in AD transgenic mice. The new Fragile X study in late brain development is entitled ""Rescue of Synaptic Phenotypes and Special Memory in Young Fragile X Mice,"" was authored by Miao-Kun Sun, Jarin Hongpaisan, and Dr.  ""What our studies consistently exhibit is that all of the synaptogenic growth factors such as BDNF, NGF, IGF, etc. are activated by Bryostatin/PKC epsilon.

"," , each of the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute (BRNI), provide further indication of the role that protein kinase C epsilon (PKCe) may play in the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Neurotrope is currently collaborating with BRNI on the development of its lead compound, bryostatin, a potent modulator of PKCe, for the treatment of patients with AD. A major hurdle in the treatment of AD is that patients only show symptoms years after the disease has already taken hold. Most treatments have focused on stimulating the neurotransmitter activity of healthy neurons in the brain, or removing the beta-amyloid plaque or tau protein which builds up in the brain as a result of the disease.  All drug development efforts to date that have targeted the removal of beta-amyloid or tau protein, have failed, and drugs approved for stimulating neurotransmitter activity have offered only short-lived, palliative results for patients. Further, these treatment strategies have had no effect on the progression of the disease and have yielded no improvement in patients' memory or cognitive performance. As reported in BRNI's recently published study, in brain samples (consisting of autopsy-confirmed AD and age- and gender-matched control samples), blindly provided by the Harvard Brain Bank, the amount of PKCe was found to be significantly reduced in specific areas of the brain that are known to be targets in early AD. In these same brain areas, the study also showed that levels of A Beta oligomers (a toxic protein formed as a result of AD) are elevated when PKCe is reduced. Remarkably similar changes were consistently found in the skin cells of AD patients when compared to their age-matched controls and as compared to patients with non-AD dementias (skin samples for the study were obtained from the cell bank at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research).  Additionally, low levels of PKCe in skin cells were strongly correlated with progression of the disease. The longer the patients had AD, the lower their levels of PKCe. Further, low levels of PKCe in the brain were significantly correlated with an accepted measure of disease severity, known as the Braak score. Dr. Alkon, Toyota Chair in Neurodegenerative Disease, Scientific Director and Professor, Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, and Chief Scientific Officer of Neurotrope, stated, ""The results of this study are compelling and warrant continued research to fully explore the importance of PKCe in the identification and treatment of patients with AD. The data compiled from this study, and that related to Neurotrope's lead compound, bryostatin -- which, in preclinical   models has shown to play an important role in slowing or reversing AD and restoring cognition, memory and motor skills -- provides additional incentive to pursue what could lead to a major shift in the medical community's approach to this debilitating and costly disease, which currently afflicts approximately 36 million people, worldwide."" , Neurotrope's Co-Chairmen and Co-Chief Executive Officers, noted, ""We believe that our Company's focus on modulating the levels of PKCe, instead of on the removal of beta-amyloid and tau protein, represents a novel, promising model for tackling what has been a highly frustrating and disappointing approach to treating this patient population.  While still early stage, bryostatin has shown the potential to restore synaptic structures and functions damaged by AD, and as such, holds the promise of becoming a new, first-in-class treatment which may provide significant improvement in quality of life. The results of BRNI's most recent study, as published in the  Messrs. Freiman and Ramat went on to say, ""The potential for bryostatin goes beyond just the treatment of patients with AD.  Due to the compound's ability to activate PKCe and to therefore stimulate the formation of new synaptic connections, the drug may have applicability to other neurodegenerative brain diseases, including patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries, stroke or mental retardation.""

"," ) announced today the publication of positive human cell culture and mouse model data of Bryostatin 1 in two peer reviewed journals: PLOS One and the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. Neurotrope's lead drug candidate, Bryostatin 1, a potent activator of the PKCepsilon enzyme that will be entering clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), has now also been shown in human cell cultures to address deficits of two critical proteins that occur in AD brains. Deficits of the enzyme neprilysin (NEP) prevent degradation of the toxic Amyloid-beta oligomer proteins that can cause synaptic loss, neurodegeneration, and dementia. Deficits of the protein HuD in early AD can also cause the loss of synapses and synaptic maturation. A second study demonstrates in a mouse model that Bryostatin 1 inhibits a key enzyme in the phosphorylation of tau protein, a hallmark of AD. Bryostatin 1 corrects the deficits of NEP by activating HuD that is also deficient in AD. In turn, Bryostatin 1 lowers the level of toxic Amyloid-beta oligomers, pathologic hallmarks of AD, via the HuD-NEP pathway. Bryostatin, via HuD activation also increases synaptogenic proteins such as BDNF, GAP43, insulin-like growth factors, and NGF (nerve growth factor). Thus, a single therapeutic agent can lower the synaptotoxic Amyloid-beta oligomers and restore lost synapses by increasing synaptogenic factors. These effects are described in two new publications, noted below, corroborating the potential therapeutic benefits Bryostatin 1 may have in the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome. , the Company's Chief Scientific Officer, report treatment of human neuronal cell cultures with Byrostatin 1 enhanced NEP association with HuD and increased NEP activity, leading to degradation of Amyloid-beta and increased cell viability. Thus, PKCepsilon activation may have therapeutic efficacy for AD by reducing neurotoxic Amyloid-beta accumulation as well as having direct anti-apoptotic and synaptogenic effects since activating HuD coordinates downstream synaptogenic growth factors.  and published in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, the authors demonstrate in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome, a major cause of mental retardation and Autism Spectrum Disorder, the ability of Bryostatin 1 to inhibit GSK-3beta, a key enzyme in the phosphorylation of tau proteins. Phosphorylated tau is the main component of the neurofibrillary tangles and is also hallmark of AD. In addition to demonstrating effects on GSK-3beta, the authors demonstrate normalization of other Fragile X abnormalities, including hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), maturation of synapses, and spatial learning and memory. Dr. Alkon stated ""These studies provide evidence of a new mechanism by which Bryostatin 1 decreases Amyloid-beta, and restores lost synapses. The Fragile X report also provides the first direct evidence of Bryostatin's ability to inhibit hyperphosphorylation of tau protein that leads to neurofibrillary tangles. These new findings add to previous data that support Bryostatin's effects of synaptic protection and enhanced cognition in AD transgenic mouse models. Collectively, these latest findings increase the likelihood that PKCepsilon activation will provide disease-modifying as well as symptomatic benefits in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.
