Sentiment analysis of press releases for public companies to develop hold/sell/buy reccomendations

## Steps
1. Develop csv file with required information (press release page, company name, time period)
2. Throw csv file into the main.py script

## Evaluation Method
Obtain polarity and sentiment for headline, and content and throw it into the below formula which applies a fixed factor rating for both properties




## Considerations and Variables

1. Industry
2. Marketcap/Size of Company
3. Diversification of Company (Products, Services, etc).
4. Geopolitical landscape (where company operates)

## Improvements

Develop polarity and sentiment for various paragraphs of article content and from there determine a method to evaluate which paragraph represents the article most thoroughly. (Will require modifying fetching script to not concatenate into a single string for `article_content`)
